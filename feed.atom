This meme hits harder when you imagine it from the perspective of someone who lives in a developing country with 20% annual money supply growth, but whose leaders use external currency financing and have offshore assets and bank accounts while constantly diluting the masses.

A few thoughts about the state of the market leading into the $BTC ETF
Everyone who wanted to sell, has done so.  Stable coins bottomed 3 months ago, and for the first time in 2 years we are actually seeing INFLOWS. Early stage reversal signs.

Pentoshi 🐧 euroPeng 🇪🇺: Pretty key update today as I've tracked this for some time 
Stable coin bleed stopped as discussed earlier in October, and has not made a new low now in over 3 months. It's even essentially had a very small uptick
