John Reed Stark: In 2022, VCs poured over $21B into crypto startups. At mid-year 2023, that number is a paltry $500M. This dramatic decline is not a cyclical correction but rather a clear and convincing harbinger. Word on the street: The crypto-emperor has no clothes.

what? you mean tardfi is buying equities related to crypto that is readily available to them on the stock market instead of highly illegal securities "alternative coins" on a canadian digital asset exchange?

Re @blknoiz06 ETH is the Michelin 5 star restaurant where the main city boulevard meets the beach promenade. Everyone is complaining it's expensive and always crowded.
Solana is a cheap eatery in the run down part of the city that has seen better times and which people are leaving.]]></summary>

Re 2) next 1Y was ... high.
N=12 and first day when Nasdaq outperformed Dow by 20% after a 6M window.
Have posted correlated variations of extreme momentum. Sometimes ST consolidation or correction but bullish IT to LT.
Usual caveats. FYI and data mining.
https://twitter.com/ResearchQf/status/1668269924219863045

QF Research: 1) NDX rose 20% above its 200D last W.
Since '85 happened 16 times (for the 1st time in M's). Unsurprising often (not always) consolidated or pulled back ST, but 15/16 were up 1Y. Avg 1Y gain = 29.4%?! Momentum is often a thing.
Only exception 2/17/87 (rose 6M then the crash).]]></summary>
